# Chatapp

This is a completely over engineered Chatapp built with Socket.io, React & Typescript.  
I wrote this simply because i wanted to learn stuff about Sockets in the nodejs world and i felt like making it unreasonably complicated.  
I also wanted to get more familiar with yarn workspaces.

If you want to try this out, just run `yarn install` in the root folder and run the respective scripts in the respective packages. I'm sure you'll be more than able to figure that out.
